## Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that starts at a given vertex and explores all its neighboring nodes at the present depth before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.

### Usage

```c
// Example usage of BFS function
bfs(adj_matrix, n, start_vertex);
```

## Depth-First Search (DFS)

Depth-First Search (DFS) is another graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

### Usage

```c
// Example usage of DFS function
dfs(adj_list, n, start_vertex);
```

## Knapsack Problem

The Knapsack problem involves selecting a combination of items with maximum value (profit) while keeping the total weight within a given capacity.

### Algorithms Included

- 0/1 Knapsack
- Fractional Knapsack

### Usage

```c
// Example usage of 0/1 Knapsack function
int max_profit = knapsack_0_1(profits, weights, n, capacity);

// Example usage of Fractional Knapsack function
float max_profit = fractional_knapsack(sack, n, capacity);
```

## Matrix Chain Multiplication

Matrix Chain Multiplication is a dynamic programming problem that involves finding the most efficient way to multiply a sequence of matrices.

### Usage

```c
// Example usage of matrix chain multiplication function
int min_scalar_multiplications = matrix_chain_multiplication(arr, n);
```

## Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

The Floyd-Warshall Algorithm is used to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph.

### Usage

```c
// Example usage of Floyd-Warshall algorithm function
floyd_warshall(graph, n);
```
