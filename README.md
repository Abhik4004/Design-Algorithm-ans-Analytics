## 🌳 Breadth-First Search (BFS)
BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that starts at the root node and explores all neighboring nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

## 🌲 Depth-First Search (DFS)
DFS is a graph traversal algorithm that starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

## ⚙️ Kruskal's Algorithm
Kruskal's algorithm finds a minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph by adding increasing cost arcs, at each step adding the next arc with the smallest weight that doesn't produce a cycle.

## 👑 N-Queens Problem
The N-Queens problem is about placing N chess queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. This means no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

## 🔢 Matrix Multiplication
Matrix multiplication is an operation that takes two matrices and produces another matrix by multiplying corresponding elements and summing the results.

## 🔄 Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is a shortest path algorithm for graphs. It finds the shortest path between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights.

## 🎒 Fractional Knapsack Problem
In the fractional knapsack problem, the goal is to maximize the total value in the knapsack by selecting fractions of items, allowing us to break items to maximize the total value.

## 🎒 0/1 Knapsack Problem
In the 0/1 knapsack problem, the goal is to maximize the total value in the knapsack by selecting whole items without breaking them, subject to a weight constraint.

## 🚀 How to Run

Each algorithm is implemented in a separate C file. To compile and run any of the algorithms, use the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
gcc algorithm.c
./algorithm
```

Replace `algorithm` with the name of the specific algorithm file you want to compile and run.
